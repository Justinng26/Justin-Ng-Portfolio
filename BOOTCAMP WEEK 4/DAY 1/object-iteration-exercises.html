		//2d. Write a control flow statement that finds out if the store is open. If it is, console log "Welcome!". If not, console log "Come back tomorrow!"

		if(outdoorStore.open === true){
			console.log("Welcome!")

        //2f. Run the checkIfOpen function in the console. Check if the output matches what you would expect given that outdoorStore.open is currently false.

		// 2g. Change the value of outdoorStore.open and verify that checkIfOpen runs correctly.
