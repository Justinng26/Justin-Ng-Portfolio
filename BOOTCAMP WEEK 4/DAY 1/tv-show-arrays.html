      console.log(tvShows)
    
      //2. How far behind are we in our tv watching endeavour?

      console.log(tvShows.indexOf("The Bachelor"))
    
      //4. Save that value as a variable, then use that value to log the string "The Bachelor".

      const bachelorIndex = tvshows.indexOf("The Bachelor");

      console.log(tvShows[bachelorIndex]);

      //9. Let's make a separate list for our Netflix favorites. Remove "Stranger Things", "Daredevil", and "The Haunting of Hill House" from the tvShows array, and populate them in a new array called netflixExclusives. Log this new array.
  
      //10. Now that we have cleaned up our original tvShows list, let's order it alphabetically and log out the array.
      
      //11. Change of plans - sort in REVERSE alphabetical order and log the array again!

      //13. Donald Glover releases a new track and you get inspired to watch "Atlanta" immediately. Add it to the start of the array and, you guessed it, log it out.

      //14. Let's make the perfect binge watching weekend plan with the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th show in the list. Make a new array called perfectWeekend, but WITHOUT removing them from the tvShows array.

      //15. Let's spice up our list. Log the perfect weekend array as a string with your favorite emoji ⭐️ in-between each TV show.

      //16. Awesome! To help with our organization lets combine the perfectWeekend and netflixExclusives arrays into a NEW array called bingeList. Log out your final array.
